##June 20: research, learning, and starting

So this is my first time making a keyboard. I had zero expeirence. I first learned how to make some basic PCBs on kicad following Joe Scotto's tutorial. Very nice guy! Link here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ&ab_channel=JoeScotto
Here is some sample circuts I made from his tutorial.

##June 21: initial design
This was kinda scary because I was so afraid of messing something up. I knew I wanted a keyboard with a rotary enocder and no number pad. Here is a reference

I made a intial sketch for the matrix. I decided to use the Ardunio Pro Micro for my MCU.

##June 21: Making the PCB
I didnt want to manually move each sqaure. So im trying to find a better solution. probably a plugin. 
Found a plugin to use. It was a absoulte pain to use. 
used a json file
this is hopefully what it should look like

This is the most painfull thing I have dome so far. the wiring was a absoulte pain in the butt
