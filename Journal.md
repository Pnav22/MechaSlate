## June 20: Research, Learning, and Starting

So this is my first time making a keyboard. I had zero experience. I first learned how to make some basic PCBs on KiCad following Joe Scotto's tutorial. Very nice guy!  
Link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ&ab_channel=JoeScotto  
Here is some sample circuits I made from his tutorial.

## June 21: Initial Design

This was kinda scary because I was so afraid of messing something up. I knew I wanted a keyboard with a rotary encoder and no number pad. Here is a reference:

I made an initial sketch for the matrix. I decided to use the Arduino Pro Micro for my MCU.

_Edit: I'm not doing the top row – the ESC row._

## June 21: Making the Schematics

Was very painful to try and get everything organized.

_Edit: I'm  doing the top row now. the ESC row._

## June 21: Making the PCB

I didn’t want to manually move each square, so I’m trying to find a better solution—probably a plugin.  
Found a plugin to use. It was an absolute pain to use.  
Used a JSON file.  
This is hopefully what it should look like:

This is the most painful thing I have done so far. The wiring was an absolute pain in the butt.

Most of this time was spent on trying to use the plugin.

## June 25: Making the CAD

This should be the easiest part.

**Back done**

**Front done**

Now just assembly.  

Finally finished the whole project. Manually putting the keycaps in took very long.
