# MechaSlate 
**A Custom-Built Mechanical Keyboard**  
by Pranav M

---

## Overview
**MechaSlate** is my first custom mechanical keyboard project, created from scratch with no prior experience. This build taught me PCB design using KiCad, CAD modeling with Fusion 360, and the use of plugins and scripts to place keyswitches.



I wanted to make this project so I could learn more about electronics and familiarize myself with more forms of engineering. It was really fun!

Added a staggering Slot pattern for the back!

####  Final Case
Manually placed all keycaps and installed everything.

#### Assembly 

It uses **threaded heat-set inserts (M3 x 5mm x 4mm)** for secure mounting. These inserts are installed into the case.

The top and bottom halves of the keyboard are fastened together using **four M3 x 16mm socket head cap screws .
